# Steve's Survival Guide: Loots, Mobs, & More!

Well, hello there, adventurer!

You must be wondering why everything’s so square and why nearly everything is out to get you, right? Fear not! I stumbled upon this **neat little handy guide** that’s sure to save your pixelated behind!

Not sure who this "Steve" guy is, but **he’s definitely onto something with this guide.** Let’s just say it’s his gift to us struggling players out here.

### What’s inside this book, you ask?

Oh, you _must_ be curious! This isn’t just any old book it's **the key to surviving the blocky wilderness** of our world.

From the familiar landscapes of the **Overworld**, the fiery depths of the **Nether**, and a place of unspeakable danger known only as **The End**, Steve’s left us with enough knowledge to navigate it all… or at least _try_ to.

### Okay, so… how do I use this thing?

That’s the easy part! Upon opening, you’ll be greeted with a **menu of three shiny boxes** at the top! Let’s break it down:

- **First Box:** _Dimensions_  
  Click this, and you’ll unlock all sorts of nifty facts about our dimensions, biomes, and even quirky little trivia Steve uncovered on his travels.

- **Second Box:** _Biomes_  
  Curious where your adventure might lead you next? Well might be best to know _where_ you're really going don't you think? You could say it might be a little scary... Especially during this **time** of _year_.

- **Third Box:** _Mobs_  
  This is where things get _interesting_. Curious about all the cute and terrifying mobs? Learn where to find them, how to defeat them, and most importantly what _loot_ they drop. **Risky?** Yes. **Worth it?** Also yes.

### What if I discover something new and want to add it to the book?

Ah, the spirit of adventure! If you’re the type who’s keen on discovering _new_ things, then don’t worry this book is **fully customizable**! If you know how to write, you can add, edit, or even remove entries. **Make it your own!**
